# Predicting the Mileage/Miles Per Gallon (mpg) of a car using some features of the car.

This repository contains the files of my data science and first machine learning project.The files presented above are: two csv data files that contain some technical specs of some cars,a file with the extension '.pkl' which is the final model with the best prediction accuracy,an a jupyter notebook with the '.ipynb' file extension which contains the python code for the whole project,
and the images of the charts presented in this project.

### Content

* Title: Auto-Mpg Data

* Source: This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University.The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition

* Relevant information: The data concerns city-fuel consumption in miles per gallon,to be predicted in terms of 3 multivariate discrete and 5 continuous attributes.The number of instances are 398 and the number of attributes are 9 including the class attribute.The attribute information are:

        1. mpg - Milieage/Miles Per Galon
        2. cylinders - the power unit of the car where gasoline is turned into power
        3. displacement - engine displacement of the car
        4. horsepower - rate of the engine performance
        5. weight - the weight of a car
        6. acceleration - the acceleration of a car
        7. model - model of the car
        8. origin - the origin of the car 
        9. car - the name of the car
